👋 Hi, I’m @Kthejesh1

👀 I’m interested in building scalable web applications and exploring new technologies in Full Stack Development.

🌱 I’m currently working with JavaScript, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Redux, and MongoDB to strengthen my development skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on frontend, backend, or full stack projects that focus on real-world problem-solving and great user experiences.
